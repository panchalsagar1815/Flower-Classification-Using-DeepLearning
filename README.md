# Flower-Classification-Using-DeepLearning

The Flower Classification project aims to develop a robust and accurate classification system for different types of flowers using the technique of data augmentation. The objective is to build a model that can classify flowers with high precision and handle variations in image data.

The project utilizes a dataset comprising images of various flower species, such as roses, sunflowers, daisies, tulips, and lilies. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the dataset, creating additional variations of the original images. These techniques include random rotations, flips, zooms, shifts, and other transformations that simulate different viewpoints and environmental conditions.

To begin the project, the dataset is preprocessed, which involves resizing the images to a standard size and converting them to a suitable format for training. The augmented dataset is then generated by applying a combination of transformations to each image, effectively expanding the diversity of the training samples.

Next, a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), is constructed to perform the flower classification task. The model architecture may consist of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer. Transfer learning can also be employed, utilizing pre-trained models such as VGG, Inception, or ResNet, to leverage their learned features and improve classification accuracy.

The augmented dataset is used to train the model, which involves feeding the images through the network and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the classification error. Techniques like batch normalization and regularization can be applied to improve generalization and prevent overfitting during training.

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to measure the model's ability to correctly classify flowers. The results are analyzed to gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Finally, the trained model can be deployed in real-world scenarios for flower classification tasks. It can be integrated into applications, websites, or systems that require automatic flower recognition, aiding in botanical research, gardening, or even assisting in the creation of flower catalogues or e-commerce platforms.

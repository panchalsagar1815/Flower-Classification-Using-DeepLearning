# Flower-Classification-Using-DeepLearning

The Flower Classification project aims to develop a robust and accurate classification system for different types of flowers using the technique of data augmentation. The objective is to build a model that can classify flowers with high precision and handle variations in image data.

The project utilizes a dataset comprising images of various flower species, such as roses, sunflowers, daisies, tulips, and lilies. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the dataset, creating additional variations of the original images. These techniques include random rotations, flips, zooms, shifts, and other transformations that simulate different viewpoints and environmental conditions.
